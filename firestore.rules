/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by enforcing strict ownership and role-based access control where applicable,
 * while relaxing data validation to enable rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/pages/{pageId}`: Stores static page data.
 * - `/categories/{categoryId}`: Stores category data.
 * - `/tags/{tagId}`: Stores tag data.
 * - `/posts/{postId}`: Stores post data.
 * - `/media/{mediaId}`: Stores media data
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No user listing is allowed.
 * - Unauthenticated access is disallowed.
 * - Owner-only access is enforced for Pages, Posts and Media.
 * - Categories and Tags are readable by any signed-in user and writable by any signed-in user, but only authorized users can update or delete.  Update and Delete operations are denied by default.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Page`, `Post` and `MediaItem` entities include an `authorId` field. This allows for simple ownership checks on pages, posts and media items without needing to perform additional reads.
