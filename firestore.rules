/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a basic security model for a CMS, focusing on who can create, read, update, and delete content.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - Pages: /pages/{pageId}
 * - Categories: /categories/{categoryId}
 * - Tags: /tags/{tagId}
 * - Posts: /posts/{postId}
 * - Media Items: /media/{mediaId}
 * - Site Settings: /site_settings/config
 * - Widget Areas: /widget_areas/{widgetAreaId}
 * - Widget Instances: /widget_instances/{widgetInstanceId}
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: Pages, Categories, Tags, and Posts are publicly readable.
 * - Owner-Only Writes: Writes (create, update, delete) to Pages, Categories, Tags, Posts, and Media Items are restricted to the author (owner). The rules validate that the `authorId` field matches the authenticated user's UID.
 * - Singleton Document for Site Settings: `site_settings/config` requires authentication for all access, due to the absence of an owner field.
 * - Widget Area and Instance Configuration: Restricted access to authenticated users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The rules rely on the presence of an `authorId` field within each Page, Post, and MediaItem document to enforce ownership.
