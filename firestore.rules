/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by enforcing strict ownership and role-based access control where applicable,
 * while relaxing data validation to enable rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/categories/{categoryId}`: Stores category data.
 * - `/tags/{tagId}`: Stores tag data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No user listing is allowed.
 * - Unauthenticated access is disallowed, based on the provided reasoning.
 * - Owner-only access is enforced where applicable.
 * - All write operations are secured by authorization checks.
